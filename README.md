Repository of the research article "Differential equation discovery of robotic swarm as active matter" in the 27th International Conference on Discovery Science 2024. 
=============================

The repository presents the results of the numerical experiments presented in the paper:

- Dynamics of a single robot without external influence (experiment_1)
- Dynamics of a single robot with external influence (experiment_2)
- General robots dynamics (experiment_3)

For each experiment, there are both input and output data. The general file discovery_science.html contains the entire experiment pipelines.

The repository also includes the images used in the article.
